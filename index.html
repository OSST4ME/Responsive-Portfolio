      <p>Welcome to my first profile page.  I don't have any pictures in this new computer, so I am using the stock, course supplied cat.  It's kind of appropriate since I have two of these "roommates" at home.</p>

      <p>This Camp has challenged me like no other course has before.  On the plus side, it has greatly increased my knowledge of the subject matter.  On the "needing to be improved" side, it seems I have more correct coding time in my sleep than when I'm awake.  But, I expect this trend to be reversed as I gain more experience </p>

      <p>I can honestly state that I am looking forward to continuing with the Camp.  I will just have to buy more treats and catnip to appease my roommates.</p>
